 </h1>
        <p class="lead">
         Fixed and Wireless Networks are both used in Mobile computing. Fixed networks commonly operate on radio transmission to connect established, wired communications systems. Let's see the differences between fixed and wireless networks in mobile computing.

         <h2 style="color: red;"> Difference between Fixed and Wireless Networks</h2>


The differences between Fixed and Wireless networks can be distinguished as that the wireless networks do not require any cables to make a physical connection with the device. It is easily assessable because it is a shared medium. On the other hand, in the case of fixed networks, a physical configuration of devices is mandatory to perform data transmission. In this medium, you have to connect every new device separately and physically to the network. Let's consider and make a comparison between these two technologies used in mobile computing.
</p>

<p class="lead">
<h4>Wireless Networks</h4>
<br>There is no requirement of any physical configuration in the wireless network.</br>
<br>The data loss rate is high in Wireless Networks.</br>
<br>In Wireless Networks, the data transmission rate is comparatively low, so it provides less speed.</br>
<br>Latency is high in Wireless Networks, which finally results in more delay.  </br>
<br>The Wireless Networks may be hacked; that's why the security is always low in this type of network. </br>
  .</p>


  <p class="lead">
<h4>Fixed Networks
</h4>
<br>In Fixed Networks, a physical configuration is required in any condition.
</br>
<br>In Fixed Networks, a perfect link is established between the devices, so; the data loss rate is very low.
</br>
<br>In Fixed Networks, the rate of data transmission is high, so it provides high speed.
</br>
<br>There is no issue of latency in Fixed Networks because there is a perfect connection established between the devices that provide less delay.</br>
<br>TFixed Networks connections are highly secured.. </br>

<h2 style="color: red;"> Issues occurred in Mobile Computing.
</h2>
<p class="lead">
   
There is a lot of advantage of using Mobile computing technology. It provides vast features from mobility to portability and from cloud to productivity. But, along with these advantages, you can face specific eye-catching issues while using mobile computing technology. Following is a list of issues we find while using fixed and wireless networks in mobile computing.



<h4>1. Costly due to Wireless Medium</h4>

The Mobile computing technology mainly focuses on wireless infrastructure, so the cost of implementation is always high. It also faces issues like efficiency, delays and security, which we have to consider in project establishment.

<h4>2. Issue due to Device Mobility</h4>

The device mobility is one of the most significant advantages of mobile computing technology. But, it is one of its major issues too. To obtain the device mobility feature of mobile computing technology, we have to install the highest standards' types of equipment. So, whenever the mobile device changes its environment, we have to restructure its configuration environment.

We have to configure the device mobility feature according to the location, environment and surroundings of a mobile device regularly.

<h4>3. Security Issues in Mobile Computing</h4>

This is undoubtedly the biggest and one of the most discussed issues we face in mobile computing technology. It arises due to the shared medium ability of mobile computing.

<div >
<h5>The most significant security issues are:</h5>
<h6>*Physical Security or Data Security</H6>
<h6>*System Security or Network Security</h6>
</div>

<div >
<h5>These issues can be resolved by using some common tactics. These issues are:</h5>

<h6>*Using VPN technology</h6>
<h6>*Using Cryptography & Network Security in your project</h6>
<h6>*Use of Firewall technology in the project</h6>

<h4 > Advantages and Disadvantages of Mobile Computing
</h4>
<p>
  
  <h6>Enhanced Productivity</h6>

We can use mobile devices in various companies, which can reduce the time and cost for clients and themselves and enhance the productivity of the company.

<h6>Location Flexibility</h6>

This technology facilitates users to work efficiently and effectively from whichever location they want to do their tasks. So, a user can work without being in a fixed position. This facility makes them able to carry out numerous tasks at the same time and also benefitted the company.

<h6>Saves Time</h6>

The location flexibility facility of mobile computing makes it time-saving. It cuts down the time consumed or wasted while traveling from different locations or to the office and back. It facilitates users to access all the essential documents and files over a secure channel and work on their computers. It has also reduced many unnecessary incurred expenses.

<h6>Support Cloud Computing</h6>

By using mobile Computing technology, you can save your documents on an online server and access them anytime and anywhere when you have an internet connection. You can access these files on several mobiles simultaneously.

<h6>Entertainment</h6>

Nowadays, mobile devices can be used as an entertainment source. They provide a lot of entertainment facilities to their users.

Besides the above advantages, it provides some other facilities such as Device Mobility, Simple Framework, easy and simple infrastructure etc.
</p>

<h4 > Disadvantages of Mobile Computing Technology

</h4>
<p>
  
  <h6>Enhanced Productivity</h6>

Along with these advantages, there are some disadvantages also of mobile computing technology. Following is the list of biggest disadvantages:

<h6>Poor Quality of Connectivity</h6>

This is one of the biggest disadvantages because if you are not near any of these connection providers, your access to the internet may be minimal.

<h6>Security Issues</h6>

Mobile VPNs are not very safe to connect, and there is always a chance of security concerns.

<h6>High on Power Consumption</h6>

These devices run on batteries that do not tend to long-lasting. So, if in a situation where there is no source of power for charging, then that will be a failure.

Besides the above, there are also some disadvantages such as low data transmission rates, High data losses, Frequent network issues etc.
