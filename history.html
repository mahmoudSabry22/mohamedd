<h4>4. Laptop</h4>
A laptop is a small, portable personal computer (PC) built in a foldable device. The folding structure of a laptop is called a clamshell form factor. The flip or clamshell is a form factor of a mobile phone or other devices that include two or more folded sections via a hinge. A laptop typically has a thin LCD or LED computer screen mounted on the inside of the clamshell's upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard on the inside of the lower lid. Laptops are easy to carry for transportation, and that's why they are best suitable for mobile use.

Osborne 1 was the first laptop in the world. See the below picture.

<h4>5. Smartphone</h4>
A smartphone is a mobile device that combines cellular and mobile computing functions into one unit. The smartphones are invented to provide more advanced computing capability and connectivity than basic feature phones.

Smartphones are different from basic feature phones by their more robust hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate more comprehensive software, internet i.e., web browsing over mobile broadband, and multimedia functionality i.e., music, video, cameras, and gaming etc., along with the core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging.

Early smartphones were invented and marketed as attempting to bridge the functionality of standalone personal digital assistant (PDA) devices with support for cellular telephony but were limited by their bulky form, short battery life, slow, analog cellular networks, and the immaturity of wireless data services. But now, smartphones have the latest features of computers, more than one camera, advanced OS, bigger RAM and ROM. Now, they are also built with some artificial intelligence features such as unlock using facial recognition or fingerprint scanners, waterproof with IP67 and IP68 ratings and many other endless features.
